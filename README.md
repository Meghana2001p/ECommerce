Remove the reduadant code
all the validations has to be placed entirely in the dto and the entity should 
hvae only the stuffs related to the databsae the many to many relationship and also thats it

the exception instead of having the different exceptions for each one of them find one common 
and that could be used 
like that can be used instead of the writing the redudant code that I am using right now 
the validation that we use on the dto should be directly caught before hitting the database  
kind of showing the exception and throwing that 


and also the normal sql query instead of the jpql and also the method names that can be understood
by that and that can be used
